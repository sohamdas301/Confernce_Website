                  in the humble barracks of Chembur Camp. But today, it proudly
                  boast of having 3, 75, 000 sq. ft. land, housing 12 buildings
                  and 28 Institutions, ranging from a crèche to Ph.D. Centers.
                  It has over 2000 teaching and non-teaching staff, and more
                  than 18,000 students who pass through its hallowed portals
                  each year.
